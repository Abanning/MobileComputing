HW0 - Getting Started

1 - My intended platform is iOS for the final project.
2 - My intended programming language is Swift. I will use XCode's built-in
    developer tools and test on devices I own.
3 - I am interested in cross-platform development, but because I am
    relatively inexperienced, I am not certain yet. If time permits, then yes.
4 - 
    a. I chose iOS for two reasons. Firstly, I have some very limited experience
        developing for iOS already. I worked for my friend for a short time
        building a cookbook app that saves recipes, tracks nutrition, and automates
        grocery lists based on a user's calendar availability and previously liked meals.
        Secondly, I recently purchased a Macbook for the first time (being an avid PC only guy
        for years), and I am actually now excited at the prospect of using XCode's features
        for Apple developers.
    b. I plan on using Swift because it is the most up-to-date/preferred language for iOS
        develoopment because of the built-in safety features and clean syntax. I also spent
        a lot of time learning how Swift and SwiftUI work, and would like to put those skills
        to use in a project.
    c. I am hesitant to believe I would be able to accomplish a cross-platform application at this
        point based on my experience level. I also tend to get big ideas, and my first thought for
        the final project is to make a game. Configuring that big of a project for two platforms 
        in the limited time we have seems bold; however, I am always open to it and if I feel confident
        in my application with some time left I may attempt it.
